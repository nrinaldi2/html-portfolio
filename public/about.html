<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Nicholas Rinaldi. I am a sophomore student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at 
  Cleveland State University. My goal is to work in Software Development as a dedicated member of an innovative team of
  like-minded individuals. However, I would also be interested in pursuing opportunities in the IT field, as solving 
  technological issues has always been an area that I excel in.</p>

<p>Since building my first computer in the 8th grade, with nothing more than a YouTube tutorial and my own stubborn nature
  to see every problem through, my passion for understanding how computers work and communicate has driven me to be 
  the detail-oriented and attentive technician that I am today. In order for a computer to serve us and our everyday tasks,
  it takes an almost unimaginably large and perfect symphony between components to produce meaningful results.
  Putting that into perspective is how I approach a team environment, in which a team is tasked with producing meaningful
  products that build the customer's image of a company.
</p>

<p>Serving an employer that puts the needs of not only their customers, but their workforce first is what I hold as most 
  important in my career. That is the policy I stand by when teaching others what I know and working alongside them.
  I want others to know that there is never a problem I'm not willing to help solve, and that there is never a time
  that I'm afraid to admit we are about to learn together.
